# CaseLoad Select — App Context

## Product

**Name:** CaseLoad Select
**Tagline:** Sign Better Cases
**Domain:** caseloadselect.ca | app.caseloadselect.ca
**Operator:** Adriano Domingues (sole operator, senior communications strategist)
**ICP:** Sole practitioners and 2-lawyer Toronto firms, growing fast, no internal marketing staff

CaseLoad Select is a done-for-you case-acquisition and selection system for Canadian law firms. The core insight: the real pain is not lead volume, it is filtering. Every inquiry looks identical at the door. The $100k case and the tire-kicker arrive the same way. CaseLoad Select scores, filters, and routes leads automatically so lawyers only see cases worth their time.

This repo contains two products:
1. **CaseLoad Select App** — CRM, pipeline, sequences, dashboard, operator tools
2. **CaseLoad Screen Engine** — GPT-powered intake screening, scoring, embeddable widget

## Operator Model

Adriano operates the system for client firms. This is done-for-you, not self-serve SaaS. Firms never access admin panels. "Firm onboarding" means Adriano's setup checklist (Clio OAuth, practice areas, pipeline stages, Google review link, branding, intake form config). Build for operator efficiency, not firm self-service.

The Client Portal (S8) IS client-facing but configured and deployed by Adriano.

## Method: The ACTS System

(FACT was the working framing through April 2026; ACTS supersedes it. The master `D:\00_Work\01_CaseLoad_Select\CLAUDE.md` is canonical. CaseLoad Screen sits in the **S** pillar; this app is the codified surface for it.)

- **A — Authority:** Content, reviews, brand trust (long-term compounding)
- **C — Capture:** SEO, GBP, local visibility infrastructure
- **T — Target:** Precision Google Ads
- **S — Screen (CaseLoad Screen):** Automated intake scoring, case qualification, priority routing across seven channels (Web, WhatsApp, SMS, Instagram, Facebook, Google Business Profile, Voice)

review_requests (id, lead_id, law_firm_id, status, sent_at)
lead_activities (id, lead_id, activity_type, metadata, created_at)
```

## Scoring Engine (scoring.ts)

The Priority Scoring Engine v2.1 computes a 0-100 priority index from two groups:

**Fit Score (max 30):** geo (0-10) + contactability (0-10) + legitimacy (0-10)
**Value Score (max 70):** complexity (0-25) + urgency (0-20) + strategic (0-15) + fee (0-10)

Bands: A >= 90 | B >= 75 | C >= 60 | D >= 45 | E < 45

### v2.2 Explainability (April 2026)

`computeScore()` now returns three additional fields:

- `confidence` (high/medium/low): Weighted data completeness ratio across 12 scorable fields. High = 75%+ weighted fill. Medium = 45-74%. Low = below 45%.
- `explanation` (string): 1-3 sentence plain-English summary ranking strongest/weakest scoring factors and flagging what missing data would improve accuracy.
- `missing_fields` (string[]): Human-readable labels for null/empty input fields.

### Incomplete Intake Nudge

When confidence = "low" and band is B or C, the system triggers an `incomplete_intake` sequence via the sequence engine. The cron at `/api/cron/incomplete-intake` runs hourly.

Sequence: 3 touches (email at 2h, SMS at 24h, email at 72h) asking for specific missing fields. Re-scores on data receipt. Exits if confidence improves, lead qualifies, or 7 days pass.

## CaseLoad Screen Engine

The GPT-powered intake screening product. How it works:

1. Firm config defines practice areas, geo boundaries, and preferences
2. `screen-prompt.ts` builds a dynamic GPT-4o-mini system prompt per firm
3. Prospect fills 5-step intake widget (IntakeWidget.tsx)
4. `/api/screen/route.ts` runs GPT screening against firm criteria
5. CPI score assigned automatically
6. Lead enters pipeline pre-qualified with confidence rating

CTA on all intake forms: **"Submit for review"** (revised 2026-05-06; the previous CTA "Start Your Consultation" implied the AI provided legal advice, which it does not). Hero headline: **"Book a call with the firm▪"** (revised 2026-05-06; replaces the firm's standard "Contact Us" form — the screen IS the contact path). Hero sub: *"Describe your situation in your own words, then answer a few short follow-ups. A lawyer reviews what you share and reaches out directly if your matter fits the firm's practice. Most replies within hours."*
Product name: **CaseLoad Screen**. "Case Review" and "Intake OS" are deprecated names.

Embeddable at `/widget/[firmId]` as iframe on firm websites.

## Lawyer Triage Portal (CaseLoad Screen 2.0 / CRM Bible v5 era)

A NEW surface inside the existing portal, alongside the legacy Dashboard / Pipeline / Phases tabs, consuming output from CaseLoad Screen 2.0 (the Vite SPA at `https://caseload-screen-v2.vercel.app`). The lawyer's daily decision surface for inbound leads.

### Distinct from the legacy machinery

The legacy `leads` table, CPI v2.1 scoring engine, 5-band system (A through E), and 12-journey sequence engine are **untouched** by this work. The triage portal reads from a NEW table (`screened_leads`) populated by a NEW endpoint (`/api/intake-v2`). The two systems run side by side; the legacy CRM Bible v3 dashboard continues serving until the legacy data is migrated or aged out (separate decision).

### Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `screened_leads` | Main store for Screen 2.0 output. Brief JSON + brief HTML + slot answers, four-axis scores, lifecycle status, decision deadline, derived flags (whale_nurture, band_c_subtrack). Migration: `20260505_screened_leads.sql`. Lifecycle enum hard-enforced: `triaging` / `taken` / `passed` / `declined`. |
| `firm_decline_templates` | Per-firm and per-practice-area decline copy. Three-layer resolver: `screened_leads.status_note` (per-lead override) → per-PA → firm default → system fallback in `lib/decline-resolver-pure`. Migration: `20260505_firm_decline_templates.sql`. |
| `webhook_outbox` | At-least-once delivery store for outbound GHL webhooks. Idempotency-keyed on `(lead_id, action)`. Migration: `20260505_webhook_outbox.sql`. |
| `unconfirmed_inquiries` | Contact-capture doctrine reject store. Rows that fail the gate (missing name AND/OR reachability) land here, NEVER in `screened_leads`, NEVER in the triage portal. Ops visibility only. Reasons: `no_contact_provided` / `abandoned` / `engine_refused`. Migration: `20260516_unconfirmed_inquiries.sql`. |
| `channel_intake_sessions` | Multi-turn intake sessions for Meta channels (Messenger / Instagram / WhatsApp). Distinct from `public.intake_sessions` which powers the web widget. Holds `engine_state` (serialized `EngineState`) for resume on next inbound from the same `(firm_id, channel, sender_id)`. Finalised once contact is captured (screened lead created) or `max_follow_ups=3` exhausted (moved to `unconfirmed_inquiries`). Migration: `20260516_channel_intake_sessions.sql`. |
| `intake_firms.facebook_page_access_token` | Meta Page access token used by Messenger Send + Instagram Send (IG inherits the linked Page's token). SECRET. service-role read only. Migration: `20260516_intake_firms_meta_access_tokens.sql`. |
| `intake_firms.whatsapp_cloud_api_access_token` | WhatsApp Cloud API access token. SECRET. service-role read only. Migration: `20260516_intake_firms_meta_access_tokens.sql`. |

### Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/portal/[firmId]/triage` | Triage queue page. Sorted Band A → B → C with deadline tiebreaker. `?band=A\|B\|C` filter. |
| `/portal/[firmId]/triage/[leadId]` | Single brief view. Renders `brief_html` verbatim, sticky Take/Pass action bar at bottom. |
| `POST /api/intake-v2` | Persistence endpoint — Screen 2.0 POSTs here. Demo skip on missing/invalid firmId. Fires `declined_oos` webhook for OOS leads. |
| `POST /api/voice-intake` | Voice channel persistence endpoint (DR-033). Receives the GHL Voice AI post-call webhook payload, runs the screen engine server-side on the transcript, inserts a `screened_leads` row with `channel='voice'`, fires the new-lead notification. Sibling to `/api/intake-v2`, not a modification of it. Requires `@google/generative-ai` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` for LLM extraction (best-effort; regex-only if the key is missing). |
| `GET/POST /api/messenger-intake` | Meta Messenger webhook. GET is the hub.verify_token handshake; POST verifies HMAC, resolves firm by Page ID via `intake_firms.facebook_page_id`, runs the engine via `channel-intake-processor` in `waitUntil` so Meta gets a fast 200 ACK while engine + LLM work (5-15s) happen in the background. `screened_leads.slot_answers.channel='facebook'`. Wired to engine end-to-end as of Block 2 of Meta App Review prep. |
| `GET/POST /api/instagram-intake` | Meta Instagram DM webhook. Same shape as Messenger. Resolves firm by IG Business Account ID via `intake_firms.instagram_business_account_id`. `channel='instagram'`. |
| `GET/POST /api/whatsapp-intake` | Meta WhatsApp Cloud API webhook. Different payload shape (entry.changes[].value.messages[]). Resolves firm by Phone Number ID via `intake_firms.whatsapp_phone_number_id`. Ignores non-text inbound (image/audio/document) and statuses-only payloads (delivery receipts). `channel='whatsapp'`. |
| `POST /api/portal/request-link` | Lawyer-initiated magic link. Resolves email via `intake_firms.branding.lawyer_email`. Always 200 to block enumeration. |
| `GET /api/portal/[firmId]/triage` | Queue API endpoint. Same data as the page. |
| `GET /api/portal/[firmId]/triage/[leadId]` | Brief API endpoint. |
| `POST /api/portal/[firmId]/triage/[leadId]/take` | Take action — flips status to `taken`, fires `taken` webhook. |
| `POST /api/portal/[firmId]/triage/[leadId]/pass` | Pass action — flips status to `passed`, body `{ note? }`, fires `passed` webhook with resolved decline copy. |
| `POST /api/portal/[firmId]/triage/[leadId]/refer` | Refer action (Band D primary affordance) — flips status to `referred`, body `{ referredTo?, note? }`, fires `referred` webhook. No decline-with-grace cadence; the firm's GHL workflow decides downstream. |
| `GET /api/cron/triage-backstop` | Backstop sweeper for expired triaging rows. Branches on band: A/B/C expiry → status='declined'; Band D expiry → status='passed' (per 2026-05-15 doctrine). Both fire `declined_backstop`. Wired, not scheduled (Hobby plan caps daily). |
| `GET /api/cron/webhook-retry` | Outbox retry sweeper. Wired, not scheduled. |
| `GET /api/admin/webhook-outbox` | Operator-visible delivery log. Accepts CRON_SECRET / PG_CRON_TOKEN bearer or operator session. Filters: `firm_id`, `status`. |
| `POST /api/admin/webhook-outbox/[outboxId]/retry` | Operator manual retry. Resets attempts to 0. Same auth shape as the listing route. |
| `/admin/triage` | Operator-only cross-firm triage queue. Firm filter + band filter. Rows link to /portal/[firmId]/triage/[leadId]. |
| `/admin/webhook-outbox` | Operator-only delivery log UI with manual retry button. |

### Auth model

Same HMAC magic-link pattern as the legacy Client Portal (`portal-auth.ts`). 48h link, 30-day session cookie, root-scoped (path `/`). Two role tiers on the token:

- `lawyer` (default): firm-scoped. Token's `firm_id` must match the requested route's firmId. Lands at /portal/[firmId]/triage.
- `operator`: cross-firm. Bypasses the firm match. Lands at /admin/triage. Operators can also view any firm's portal pages with an "Operator view" banner.

`firm_lawyers` table holds the canonical mapping of email → firm + role. Multi-lawyer per firm supported. Legacy `intake_firms.branding.lawyer_email` remains as a fallback. Inserting a row into `firm_lawyers` automatically fires a magic-link invitation email via the `trg_firm_lawyers_invite` pg_net trigger.

### GHL webhook contract

Versioned artifact at `docs/ghl-webhook-contract.md`. Five actions (`taken`, `passed`, `referred`, `declined_oos`, `declined_backstop`), one common envelope, action-specific extension keyed by action name. Idempotency: `<lead_id>:<action>`. Delivery: at-least-once via the outbox.

`declined_oos` is dormant in the intake path as of 2026-05-15 — OOS leads now land as Band D triaging and only fire decline-with-grace through lawyer-initiated Pass or the deadline backstop (`declined_backstop`). The action remains in the contract for the deadline-backstop path and any future engine-spam handling.

### Locked decisions (CRM Bible v5)

| Decision | Value |
|---|---|
| Whale nurture trigger | `value_score ≥ 7 AND readiness_score ≤ 4` |
| Decision-deadline tiers | 48h default; 24h at urgency ≥ 6; 12h at urgency ≥ 8; 96h for Band D OOS (urgency overrides apply) |
| Lifecycle states | `triaging` / `taken` / `passed` / `referred` / `declined` (hard-enforced via DB CHECK constraint) |
| Bands | `A` / `B` / `C` (in-scope axis lift) / `D` (refer-eligible OOS) |
| Decline copy resolution | per-lead override → per-PA → firm default → system fallback |
| Webhook delivery | At-least-once via `webhook_outbox`, exponential backoff, max 5 attempts |
| Band D doctrine (2026-05-15) | **Engine sorts attention, lawyer decides outcome.** All inbound — in-scope and OOS — lands as `status='triaging'`. OOS carries `band='D'` (refer-eligible) with a 96h decision window. Auto-decline is removed from the intake path; decline-with-grace fires only on lawyer-initiated Pass or the deadline backstop. Band D card surfaces **Refer · Take · Pass**. `'declined'` is reserved for future engine-spam / abuse handling. The triage portal swaps the prior "Declined" tab for a "History" tab covering `passed / referred / declined`. Supersedes the 2026-05-14 visibility doctrine. |
| Contact-capture doctrine (2026-05-15) | **No contact, no lead.** Triggered by a Family Law smoke test that produced a "Forwarded to firm" brief with zero contact fields populated — the lawyer had no way to reach the person. Required for persistence: `client_name` AND (`client_email` OR `client_phone`). Briefs that fail the gate land in `unconfirmed_inquiries`, NEVER in `screened_leads`, NEVER in the triage portal. Engine `buildReport()` computes `LawyerReport.contact_complete`; every route (`/api/intake-v2`, `/api/voice-intake`, Meta receivers via `channel-intake-processor`) checks it before insert. Meta channels add multi-turn follow-up: state persists in `channel_intake_sessions`, a follow-up question is sent via the channel's Send API (Messenger / Instagram / WhatsApp), and after `MAX_FOLLOW_UPS=3` failed attempts the row moves to `unconfirmed_inquiries` with `reason='engine_refused'`. Hourly cron `/api/cron/expire-channel-intake-sessions` sweeps abandoned sessions to `unconfirmed_inquiries` with `reason='abandoned'`. Engine system prompt rule 9 instructs the LLM to ask for name + (email OR phone) and never finalise without them. Voice auto-passes via caller-ID phone seeding; if Voice AI fails to capture the name the row lands as `unconfirmed_inquiry` (SMS follow-back deferred). |

### Cron scheduling — Supabase pg_cron + pg_net

Both crons are scheduled via Supabase pg_cron (no Vercel Pro dependency):

- `triage-backstop-hourly` — `7 * * * *`, calls `/api/cron/triage-backstop`
- `webhook-retry-5m` — `*/5 * * * *`, calls `/api/cron/webhook-retry`

Migration `20260506_pg_cron_pg_net_setup.sql` enables `pg_cron` and `pg_net`, stores the bearer token in Supabase Vault as `pg_cron_token`, defines `cron_internal.call_cron_route(path)` (reads token from Vault, posts to `https://app.caseloadselect.ca` via pg_net), and schedules the two jobs.

Auth: routes accept either `CRON_SECRET` or `PG_CRON_TOKEN` via Bearer token (`lib/cron-auth.ts`, constant-time compare). Both tokens are also accepted by `/api/admin/webhook-outbox/*` for ops scripts. The operator can rotate one without affecting the other.

Run history is visible via `cron.job_run_details` and pg_net responses via `net._http_response`.

### Lead notifications (Band D doctrine, 2026-05-15)

Every persisted lead lands as `status='triaging'` with a band assigned by the engine and fires a fan-out email to all `firm_lawyers` rows with `role='lawyer'` for the firm. Doctrine: "The engine sorts attention, the lawyer decides outcome." OOS matters carry `band='D'` (refer-eligible) with a 96h decision window so the lawyer can Refer / Take / Pass. Auto-decline is removed from the intake path; decline-with-grace fires only on lawyer-initiated Pass or backstop expiry.

Three notification treatments share the navy header band but differ at the subject, eyebrow, status panel, and CTA:

- **Band A/B/C triaging** — subject prefix `Priority A —` / `New lead —`. Shows decision-window countdown, prompts Take / Pass. CTA: "Open the brief".
- **Band D triaging (refer-eligible OOS)** — subject `Priority D — Name · Refer opportunity · <Practice Area>`. Status panel explains the matter is outside the firm's practice areas, surfaces the 96h window, and offers Refer / Take / Pass. CTA: "Open the brief".
- **Declined** (dormant intake-path-wise; reserved for future engine-spam / abuse handling) — subject prefix `[Auto-filtered]`. Builder retained so a future spam-block path can engage it without re-writing.

**Channel-aware subject suffix:** when the inbound channel is anything other than `web`, the subject appends ` (via <label>)` — e.g. `Priority B — Sarah · Wrongful Dismissal (via WhatsApp)`. Web leads are silent (most common channel). The status panel in the email body also shows an "Inbound via" line for non-web channels.

All four entry points fire notifications: `/api/intake-v2` (web), `/api/voice-intake` (GHL Voice AI), and the three Meta-channel receivers via `lib/channel-intake-processor`. Builders are pure (`lib/lead-notify-pure.ts`); I/O wrapper (`lib/lead-notify.ts`) resolves recipients and dispatches via Resend. Best-effort — failure does not block intake. Falls back to legacy `branding.lawyer_email` when no firm_lawyers row exists.

### Compliance pages

- `/privacy` — PIPEDA-aware retention table tied to `lib/data-retention.ts`. Public.
- `/terms` — LSO Rule 4.2-1 calibrated. No outcome promises, lawyer-client relationship is between lead and engaged firm. Public.
- Footer links from portal, admin, login.

### Phase 4+ deferred

- Webhook delivery `vercel.json` cron (currently the Supabase pg_cron path; the Vercel slot remains unused)
- Supabase Realtime queue subscription (replace RefreshOnFocus)
- HMAC signature header on outbound webhooks (when GHL adds inbound shared-secret support)
- v5 operator dashboard reading from `screened_leads` (deferred until real lead flow accumulates)

## Channels (seven canonical)

Screen 2.0 produces lead briefs from seven input channels. The engine is the same for all of them; the channel field on `EngineState` carries the channel-specific behaviour (budget, contact pre-fill, brief chip, open-questions copy).

| Channel | Inbound surface | Engine where it runs | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|---|
| Web widget | Vite SPA (`caseload-screen-v2.vercel.app`) | Client-side (sandbox engine) | `POST /api/intake-v2` (this app, receives pre-rendered brief) |
| Facebook Messenger | Meta webhook to a connected FB Page | Server-side via `lib/channel-intake-processor` | `POST /api/messenger-intake` (resolves firm by `intake_firms.facebook_page_id`) |
| Instagram DM | Meta webhook to a connected IG Business Account | Server-side via `lib/channel-intake-processor` | `POST /api/instagram-intake` (resolves firm by `intake_firms.instagram_business_account_id`) |
| WhatsApp | Meta Cloud API webhook to a connected Phone Number | Server-side via `lib/channel-intake-processor` | `POST /api/whatsapp-intake` (resolves firm by `intake_firms.whatsapp_phone_number_id`) |
| SMS / GBP | Vite SPA tabs (production handlers TBD per channel) | Client-side (sandbox engine) | `POST /api/intake-v2` (same persistence path) |
| Voice | GHL Voice AI inbound calls | Server-side (this app at `src/lib/screen-engine/`, mirrored from sandbox) | `POST /api/voice-intake` (this app, builds brief from transcript) |

The three Meta-channel receivers share `lib/channel-intake-processor.ts` so the engine pipeline (initialiseState → seed sender → evidence pass → LLM extract → buildReport → render brief HTML → insert into `screened_leads` → fire new-lead notification → fire OOS webhook if needed) is identical across them. Firm resolution lives in `lib/firm-resolver.ts`. Asset-ID columns on `intake_firms` (added 2026-05-14): `facebook_page_id`, `instagram_business_account_id`, `whatsapp_phone_number_id`, each with a partial unique index. Receivers HMAC-verify via `lib/meta-webhook-auth.ts`, ACK 200 within ~1-2s, and run the engine in `waitUntil` so Meta does not retry on the 5-15s LLM call.

The engine port at `src/lib/screen-engine/` is a byte-for-byte mirror of the sandbox `src/engine/`. Discipline: changes land in both repos in the same commit, enforced by `bash scripts/check-engine-sync.sh`. See CRM Bible DR-033 for the architecture decision.

## Sequence Engine (sequence-engine.ts + send-sequences.ts)

`triggerSequence(leadId, triggerEvent)` inserts scheduled rows into `email_sequences`. The generic processor `src/lib/send-sequences.ts` runs every 15 minutes via `/api/cron/send-sequences` and sends due rows. Exit conditions per trigger_event are enforced: if a lead has moved away from the expected stage, remaining scheduled steps are skipped.

All trigger events:
`new_lead` · `no_engagement` · `client_won` · `no_show` · `stalled_retainer` · `incomplete_intake` · `spoke_no_book` · `consulted_no_sign` · `retainer_awaiting` · `consultation_scheduled` · `review_request` · `matter_active` · `re_engagement` · `relationship_milestone` · `long_term_nurture`

## 12-Journey Architecture

All 12 journeys are built and seeded.

| Journey | Name | Trigger | Touches |
|---|---|---|---|
| J1 | New Lead Response | new_lead | WF-03 persistence engine |
| J2 | Consultation Reminders | consultation_scheduled | 3-touch (0h, 48h, 96h) |
| J3 | No-Show Recovery | no_show | WF-05 engine |
| J4 | Persistence Engine | new_lead | WF-03 11-day cadence |
| J5A | Recovery A: Spoke, No Book | spoke_no_book | 4-touch 14 days |
| J5B | Recovery B: Consulted, No Sign | consulted_no_sign | 5-touch 21 days |
| J6 | Retainer Awaiting Signature | retainer_awaiting | 4-touch 10 days |
| J7 | Welcome/Onboarding | client_won | 4-touch 7 days |
| J8 | Active Matter Update | matter_active | 3-touch (14d, 28d, 56d) |
| J9 | Google Review Request | review_request | 3-touch (0h, 72h, 168h) |
| J10 | Re-Engagement | re_engagement | 2-touch (90d, 180d) — fires on client_lost |
| J11 | Relationship/Milestone | relationship_milestone | 2-touch (6mo, 12mo) |
| J12 | Long-Term Nurture | long_term_nurture | 2-touch (18mo, 24mo) |

## Conflict Check System (BUILT)

Pipeline gate between Qualified → Consultation Scheduled. Blocks stage move with HTTP 422 if check has not passed.

**Files:** `src/lib/conflict-check.ts`, `/api/leads/[id]/conflict-check`, `/api/admin/conflict-register/import`

**Tables:** `conflict_register` (client history), `conflict_checks` (per-lead results)

**Two check paths:**
- Clio connected → queries Clio `/contacts` API (name fuzzy, email exact, phone exact)
- No Clio → queries `conflict_register` table (CSV import baseline + client_won auto-entries)

**Results:** `clear` · `potential_conflict` (name similarity — operator reviews) · `confirmed_conflict` (email/phone exact — hard block)

**Override:** POST `/api/leads/[id]/conflict-check` with `{ override_reason }` clears a `potential_conflict`.

**Auto-registration:** Every `client_won` stage change calls `registerWonClient()` to add the lead to `conflict_register` (source: `caseload_select`).

**CSV import:** POST `/api/admin/conflict-register/import` with `{ firm_id, rows[] }` — idempotent, batched.

## Pipeline Stages (9 total)

`new_lead` → `contacted` → `qualified` → `consultation_scheduled` → `consultation_held` → `no_show` → `proposal_sent` → `client_won` → `client_lost`

Conflict gate: `qualified` → `consultation_scheduled` (hard block until check passes).

## PIPEDA Compliance

`src/lib/data-retention.ts` — band-based retention (A/B=1095d, C=365d, D=180d, E=30d, null=90d). Anonymizes (replaces PII, keeps scoring) — never deletes rows. Runs daily at 3am via `/api/cron/data-retention`.

`/api/admin/leads/[id]/purge` — immediate right-to-deletion for written data subject requests.

## Client Portal (S8)

`/portal/[firmId]` — firm-facing dashboard. Magic link auth (HMAC-SHA256, 48h, no DB table). Session cookie: httpOnly, 30-day, `/portal` scoped.

Routes: `/api/portal/generate`, `/api/portal/login`, `/api/portal/[firmId]/leads`, `/api/portal/[firmId]/metrics`.

### Client Dashboard (3-Tier, inside portal)

Three tabs within the portal. Data from Supabase, polled on page load + every 5 minutes.

**Tier 1 — Partner Dashboard** (`/portal/[firmId]/dashboard`): Hero metrics row (3 tiles, 40pt, configured per firm via `intake_firms.hero_metrics` JSONB) + 7 standard KPI tiles (inquiries MTD, qualified leads, signed cases, CPSC, median response time, pipeline value, funnel conversion rate). Each tile: number + delta vs prior month + 6-week sparkline + benchmark indicator (green/amber/red dot). YoY sparkline comparison where 12+ months of data exist. Collapsible "Since Engagement Start" panel below tiles showing cumulative metrics (total leads, qualified, signed cases, pipeline value, response time improvement, CPSC trajectory). Reuses admin KPI tile component with benchmark extension.

**Tier 2 — Pipeline View** (`/portal/[firmId]/pipeline`): Funnel conversion bar at top showing stage-to-stage conversion rates (>40% drop-off = red flag). Read-only kanban below. Mirrors admin pipeline, strip drag-drop. Filterable by practice area and date range. Cards show first name + last initial, practice area, CPI band badge, days in stage.

**Tier 3 — FACT Phases** (`/portal/[firmId]/phases`): Four cards (Filter, Authority, Capture, Target). Filter card: band distribution bar + SLA gauge. Authority/Capture/Target: placeholder until BrightLocal/GA4/Google Ads API wired. Placeholder text: "Connecting [Phase] data. Your weekly report covers this phase until the live feed is active."

New API routes: `/api/portal/[firmId]/dashboard` (Tier 1 metrics + hero config + benchmarks + cumulative data), `/api/portal/[firmId]/pipeline` (Tier 2 pipeline state + conversion rates), `/api/portal/[firmId]/phases` (Tier 3 FACT metrics).

New schema columns: `intake_firms.hero_metrics` (JSONB, default `["signed_cases","cpsc","median_response_time"]`), `intake_firms.metric_definitions` (JSONB, client-agreed definitions from onboarding). New table: `industry_benchmarks` (static reference data for benchmark comparisons).

Access: firm_owner and firm_admin see all tiers. No client sees raw CPI scores or AI screening rationale (operator-only). Row-level security on Supabase enforces tenant isolation.

Full spec: CRM Bible v3.0, Section 9. Build prompt: `05_Product/prompts/PROMPT_Client_Dashboard_Build_v2.md`.

## Custom Domains (S9)

`src/middleware.ts` (edge runtime) — hostname detection, Supabase REST lookup, rewrites traffic to `/portal/[firmId]` or `/widget/[firmId]`.

`src/lib/vercel-domains.ts` — Vercel API integration. `/api/admin/domains` — manage custom domains.

## Analytics

`/analytics` — Filter Performance dashboard. 8 KPI cards, band distribution (all-time vs last month), channel mix, practice areas, filter activity grid.

## Onboarding Checklist

`/onboarding` — operator setup validator. 4 required + 5 optional checks per intake_firms record. Required: practice_areas, geo_config, branding, ghl_webhook. Optional: Clio OAuth, widget live, custom domain, scoring weights, conflict register loaded.

## Clio Manage Integration

- On `client_won`: auto-create Clio contact + matter via `src/lib/clio-conversion.ts`
- Conflict check queries Clio API v4 `/contacts` for firms with Clio connected (Path A)
- S8 Client Portal reads Clio matters for the portal dashboard
- Token storage: `intake_firms.clio_config` JSONB — auto-refreshes on expiry

## Key Workflows

**New Lead:**
Form submission → leads table → computeScore() → pipeline (new_lead stage)
→ if confidence low + band B/C: trigger incomplete_intake sequence
→ else: trigger new_lead sequence (step 1 immediate, step 2 at 24h, step 3 at 72h)

**Conflict Gate:**
Lead in qualified → operator runs check from pipeline card → result stored in conflict_checks
→ clear: lead may advance to consultation_scheduled
→ potential_conflict: operator adds override_reason, then may advance
→ confirmed_conflict: hard block, cannot advance

**Client Won:**
stage = client_won → review_requests insert (status: pending) → triggerSequence × 4
(J9 review_request, J8 matter_active, J11 relationship_milestone, J12 long_term_nurture)
→ createClioMatter (background, non-fatal) → registerWonClient (conflict register)

**send-sequences cron (every 15 min):**
email_sequences WHERE status=scheduled AND scheduled_at ≤ now()
→ batch-load steps + templates + leads → check exit condition → send → mark sent/skipped

## Constraints

- Ontario / LSO Rule 4.2-1 compliance is non-negotiable. No outcome promises, no "specialist" or "expert" language, no unverifiable superlatives.
- Practice-area agnostic. Do not default to immigration examples.
- CASL compliance: consent capture, 6-month implied consent expiry.
- PIPEDA: data residency, breach protocol, right to deletion — BUILT (data-retention.ts).
- All automation runs server-side (Next.js API routes).
- GHL handles SMS/phone. CaseLoad Select handles intake, scoring, pipeline, sequences, portal.

## Language Position

CaseLoad Select is language-agnostic at intake, English at the lawyer surface. The CaseLoad Screen widget accepts intake in any language Gemini can handle. The screen engine auto-detects the lead's language and continues the conversation in that language. The brief the lawyer reads is always English — the screen engine translates the lead's responses to English when generating the structured brief. UI chrome defaults to English; the intake conversation does not.

This is a deliberate competitive position for the Toronto multilingual market. Four axes that must not be conflated:
1. Intake tool language (widget conversation, screen engine dialogue): matches the lead's language
2. Client language (the lead's native language): whatever it is
3. Brief language (the structured doc the lawyer reads): always English
4. Lawyer language capacity (the firm's ability to serve in a given language): per-lead decision, per-firm capability

Implementation notes:
- `screen-engine/llm/prompt.ts` `buildSystemPrompt()` includes rule 8 (MULTILINGUAL INPUT): extraction still uses English option strings verbatim; `__detected_language` gives Gemini the hook to return the ISO 639-1 code when franc confidence was below threshold (DR-035)
- `screened_leads.brief_html` is always English regardless of intake language
- `screened_leads.intake_language` stores the ISO 639-1 code of the lead's intake language (populated by both `/api/intake-v2` from the body field and `/api/voice-intake` from `state.language`). Migration: `20260512_intake_language_and_raw_transcript.sql`
- `screened_leads.raw_transcript` stores the lead's raw original-language text for LSO compliance and audit reference. For voice leads: the full call transcript. For web leads: the initial description when non-English. Never rendered in the triage portal
- Language detection pipeline: `franc` (extractor.ts) → `__detected_language` LLM confirmation when uncertain (schema.ts / control.ts) → `state.language` → persisted as `intake_language`
- Triage portal shows a language badge on the queue card and a callout banner on the brief page for non-English leads (`src/lib/intake-language-label.ts`)
- New-lead notification email includes the intake language when non-English (`lead-notify-pure.ts`, `lead-notify.ts`)
- GHL webhook `CommonEnvelope` now includes `intake_language` (v2 of the contract); GHL workflows can branch on this for language-capable routing or translated decline templates
- The triage portal is English-only; no language toggle or translation pane
- No per-firm language whitelist; every firm gets language-agnostic intake by default

## Do Not

- Build firm-facing admin panels or self-serve configuration
- Default to immigration examples (practice-area agnostic)
- Use mock or seed data in any production-facing component
- Change the tech stack without explicit instruction
- Use em dashes anywhere in copy or UI text
- Use banned AI vocabulary (delve, tapestry, landscape, pivotal, testament, vibrant, intricate, meticulous, garner, interplay, underscore, bolstered, fostering, showcasing, highlighting, emphasizing, enhance, crucial, enduring, boasts, align with, valuable)
- Allow orphan words (single word alone on last line of any text block)

## Retainer Agreement Automation (DEPRECATED — REMOVED FROM SCOPE 2026-05-06)

The retainer document workflow is permanently lawyer-owned. Retainer document generation and e-signature are explicitly out of scope. Use Clio (for Clio firms) or the lawyer's own tool of choice. CaseLoad Select fires the J6 follow-up cadence; the document itself is never touched by the platform.

**Dormant code (do not call from new code; do not extend):**
- `src/lib/docugenerate.ts` — PDF generation client. Dormant.
- `src/lib/docuseal.ts` — e-signature client. Dormant.
- `src/lib/retainer.ts` — orchestration. Dormant. The `triggerRetainerIfEligible()` call from `/api/otp/verify` should be removed in a follow-up cleanup; until then it is a no-op without the env vars set.
- `src/app/retainers/page.tsx` — admin page. Dormant; should be removed in a follow-up cleanup.
- `/api/webhooks/docuseal` — webhook receiver. Dormant.

**Dormant table:** `retainer_agreements` is unused after 2026-05-06. Leave in place; do not run a destructive migration without explicit operator confirmation.

**Env vars retired:** `DOCUGENERATE_API_KEY`, `DOCUGENERATE_TEMPLATE_ID`, `DOCUSEAL_API_KEY`, `DOCUSEAL_TEMPLATE_ID`, `DOCUSEAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Safe to unset in Vercel; the dormant code degrades to no-op without them.

See master `CLAUDE.md` Build Roadmap for the formal scope-removal note (S6 retired 2026-05-06) and CRM Bible v5.1 DR-032 for the doctrine entry.

## Env Vars to Add in Vercel

`CLIO_CLIENT_ID` · `CLIO_CLIENT_SECRET` · `CLIO_REDIRECT_URI` · `VERCEL_API_TOKEN` · `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` · `GEMINI_API_KEY` (used by `/api/voice-intake` for LLM extraction; if missing, the endpoint falls back to regex-only and the row still persists)

(DocuGenerate and DocuSeal env vars are retired with S6; safe to unset in Vercel.)

## Brand Assets

All CaseLoad Select logo files are served from `/brand/logos/` (public folder). Use these — never recreate logos in code.

### Naming convention

`{variant}-{theme}-{background}.png`

| Segment | Options |
|---|---|
| variant | `icon`, `wordmark`, `wordmark-tagline`, `lockup-horizontal`, `lockup-horizontal-tagline`, `lockup-stacked` |
| theme | `light` (navy/gold on transparent or white bg), `dark` (white/gold on dark bg) |
| background | `transparent` (use on coloured backgrounds), `bg` (has its own white/dark background baked in) |

### Quick reference

| Use case | File |
|---|---|
| Dark header / navy background | `/brand/logos/lockup-horizontal-dark-transparent.png` |
| Light header / white or parchment background | `/brand/logos/lockup-horizontal-light-transparent.png` |
<!-- NOTE: the Brand Assets quick reference table was truncated by an Edit tool host-side write limit on 2026-05-11. The lockup-stacked, icon, and wordmark variant rows + the long footer paragraphs need restoring from git history before the next commit. The Voice channel / FACT-to-ACTS edits above this point are correct and intact. -->
